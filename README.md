# Spotify Stats

Spotify Stats is a Chatbot Web App that provides insight into users' Spotify streaming history. As evident with the yearly buzz whenever Spotify Wrapped comes out, people are very interested into their listening patterns. Spotify Stats allows users to get much more detailed insights on their streaming history at any time. Users can upload their streaming data (downloable from Spotify on https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/) to the app, and then ask questions such as "What are my top 3 most streamed songs in November 2019?" or "What is my most streamed Bruno Mars song?". This app uses the OpenAI API to generate SQL queries to perform on an SQLite database containing the data uploaded by the user.
